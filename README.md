# Hey there, Welcome to my Github!

ðŸ‘‹ Â Hi, Iâ€™m Vien <br/>
Amateur GitHub User. Slowly progressing through the land of Git; so bear with the noobishness. Primarily I am going to be using GitHub as a platform to document, create opinionated posts about experiences, and to blog about my journey breakiing into CyberSecurity. <br/> <br/>
Currently I'm working towards my Bachelors in CyberSecurity while supplementing other supporting hands-on-labs like TryHackMe, RangeForce, BTLO, INE, and AttackIQ. <br/>
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with like minded individuals who are new to cybersecurity and professionals who are in it.
